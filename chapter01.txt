If you've ever had the opportunity to go to the american museum of natural history, there is a fossil of a narwhal that is quite impressive. I have a cousin who thinks that Narwhals arent real, so what i like to do is send her pictures of Narwhal fossils and then she will reply no, those are sea unicorns, you are so silly.
