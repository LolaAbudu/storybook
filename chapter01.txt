If you've ever had the opportunity to go to the american museum of natural history, there is a fossil of a narwhal that is quite impressive. I have a cousin who thinks that Narwhals arent real, so what i like to do is send her pictures of Narwhal fossils and then she will reply no, those are sea unicorns, you are so silly.

This one time, i was six years old, i thought ii found a wedding ring on the beach but it turned out to be a blow pop, and mom my yelled at me for picking up gross garbage covered in sand.
